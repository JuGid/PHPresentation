### How to use it ?
- Download files or clone this repository
- Run `composer install`
- Create your PHPresentation in `index.php` file
- Run the PHP Internal server in ~/PHPresentation `php -S localhost:8000`
- Open `http://localhost:8000` in your favorite browser

### Why PHPresentation ?
This is a training project to improve my design pattern skills and PHP knowledge.
**I will be happy if you can help me in this quest**.
PHPresentation can be used if you have a presentation to do and you don't have so much time to create it. It's easy, fast and pretty (for me it is)

### What it uses ?

 - `PHP` as main language
 - `HTML/CSS` for rendering in addition to `Twig` for templating
 - `PHPUnit` for testing (when it will be done, sorry)

### More
This is not even the first release. I have much things to do before a v1.0.0. I have a Trello to help me and I can share if you ask (French). 
PHPresentation will be improved each week. Next things to come :

 1. Improve the base template
 2. Add options to components for personalization
 3. Add more components (like PHPGrid, PHPCode or PHPCard)
 4. Block number of components on a slide to avoid bad rendering by a weight system
 5. Unit tests to ensure working

And decisions I have to make:

 - Is it usefull here to use Twig cache
 - Change for another CSS Framework (Bootstrap seems too heavy for the job)

*Last thing : Sorry for my english writing skill...*
